# Circle Type

This is a simple typing game built in React that I made for Dorm Room Fund's coding challenge thing.
I built a typing game because I'm a little bit boring and like typing games for keeping my typing speed up. Also thought it'd be kind interesting to
create one that uses a "beat the clock" type mechanic cause it hasn't been done too much.
It's built with `styled-components` and uses nothing but React Hooks. Also please note that it was built in a pretty short amount of time,
so tests and best practices might not exist.
