# Circle Type

This is a simple typing game built in React that I made for Dorm Room Fund's coding challenge thing.
It's built with `styled-components` and uses nothing but Hooks. Also please note that it was built in a pretty short amount of time,
so tests and best practices might not exist.

## To Run:

Clone the repo:

`git clone https://github.com/samwightt/CircleType.git`

`cd CircleType`

Install all dependencies:

`yarn`

Run the dev server:

`yarn start`

Build the app for production

`yarn build`
